Follow these steps to determine the constituents and amount of alkalinity in the supplied water sample:

1. Take standard 0.1N NaOH and 0.5N acetic acid solutions.  
2. Take five cleaned and dried reagent bottles with stoppers and number them 1–5.  
3. To the reagent bottles add 1g each, activated charcoal.  
4. Add 50 ml of 0.5 N acetic acid in the reagent bottle labeled as No. 1, similarly add 40 ml, 30 ml, 20 and 10 ml of acetic acid to the bottles labeled as No.2-4, respectively and make up the solution up to 50 ml by adding distilled water.  
5. Stopper the bottles tightly and shake them for 40 minutes in the shaker.  
6. After shaking for 40 min keep the bottles in a thermostat maintained at 25°C for at least one hour or leave them at room temperature.          
7. The solutions from each bottle are filtered in separate beaker (labeled as No. 1-5) through a clean and dry filter paper. After rejecting the first 5ml of the filtrate collect it.
8. Titrate 10 ml of filtrate of each beaker separately against 0.1N solution of NaOH using phenolphthalein as an indicator till the end point (appearance of pink color) is reached.  
9. Repeat the process for concordant reading. The time for which charcoal remains in contact with acetic acid in different bottles is kept constant.
